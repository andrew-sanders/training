        <p>I'm 26 and originally from Maryland, but just recently moved from New York City. I enjoy bands ranging from Illuminati Hotties to Machine Girl to The Dillinger Escape Plan and really anything crazy that most people probably wouldn't enjoy. I also love to cook, bake bread, and play fighting games.</p>
